                Elon Musk, (born June 28, 1971, Pretoria, South Africa),
                South African-born American entrepreneur who cofounded the electronic-payment firm PayPal
                and formed SpaceX, maker of launch vehicles and spacecraft.
                He was also one of the first significant investors in, as well as chief executive officer 
            of, the electric car manufacturer Tesla.
            </p>
            <h3>Early Life</h3>
            <p>He displayed an early talent for computers and 
                entrepreneurship. At age 12 he created a video 
                game and sold it to a computer magazine. 
            </p>
            <h3>Paypal and SpaceX</h3>
            <p>In 1995 Musk founded Zip2, a company that provided maps and business directories to online newspapers. In 1999 Zip2 was bought by the computer manufacturer Compaq for $307 million, and Musk then founded an online financial services company, X.com, which later became PayPal, which specialized in transferring money online. The online auction eBay bought PayPal in 2002 for $1.5 billion.</p>
        
            <p>In 2002 he founded Space Exploration Technologies (SpaceX) to make more affordable rockets. Its first two rockets were the Falcon 1 (first launched in 2006) and the larger Falcon 9 (first launched in 2010), which were designed to cost much less than competing rockets.</p>
        
        <h3>
            Tesla
        </h3>
        <p>Musk had long been interested in the possibilities of electric cars, and in 2004 he became one of the major funders of Tesla Motors (later renamed Tesla). In 2006 Tesla introduced its first car, the Roadster, which could travel 245 miles (394 km) on a single charge. Unlike most previous electric vehicles, which Musk thought were stodgy and uninteresting, it was a sports car that could go from 0 to 60 miles (97 km) per hour in less than four seconds</p>
